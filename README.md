# Task_App
Thanks for tooking at this Basic Task App! You are able to access a task list based on an email (not sign in due to lack of Authentication).
Full App utilizing CRUD and PSQL DB. You are able to toggle from red side to green side for the tasks. 

boy oh boy... this a project that was both simple yet a beautiful mess.

Vanilla JS, and HTML will sprinkling of Jquery. This was all to hone the skill learned during my Operational Level up lessons.


Optimization:

Outside of using react... Hiding elements better. UI was smooth for the simple features but optimizing it with React and better lay out for the items/tasks.
Add Authentication/Authorization.
